To make the program appealing for the user and enable
the characters as large ASCII art characters we have to think
of the way how to print the grid representation depending
of the grid state. It's not that straighforward as it might
seem.

The trouble is that each "large" ASCII art character is stored
in several lines and columns, so i.e. changing center grid position
involves printing the character in the middle of the grid.

I have to find a way to represent the grid state with ASCII art.
